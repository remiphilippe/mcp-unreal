<!-- Source: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/UWorld -->

The World is the top level object representing a map or a sandbox in which Actors and Components will exist and be rendered.

A World can be a single Persistent Level with an optional list of streaming levels that are loaded and unloaded via volumes and blueprint functions or it can be a collection of levels organized with a World Composition.

In a standalone game, generally only a single World exists except during seamless area transitions when both a destination and current world exists. In the editor many Worlds exist: The level being edited, each PIE instance, each editor tool which has an interactive rendered viewport, and many more.
